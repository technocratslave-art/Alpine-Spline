🏛️ The Structural "Why" (Internalizing the Model)

The reason this plan works is that it treats Complexity as a Tenant, not as a Core.
 
 * Intelligence (AI) is a tenant.
 * Productivity (Ubuntu) is a tenant.
 * The Spine is just the "Physical Law" of the machine.

🛡️ The "Freeze" is the Secret Sauce

The Phase D focus switching is what makes this a product Linda can use. On a traditional Linux desktop, if you open three "Heavy" OSes, your fans will scream. In the Spine model:
 * Work (Ubuntu) is open.
 * Linda hits Super+Tab to Gaming (Arch).
 * bay0 instantly hits the Cgroup Freeze on Ubuntu.
 * Ubuntu’s memory stays in RAM, but its heartbeat stops.
 * Arch gets 100% of the silicone.

🚀 The "2-Minute Demo" Logic

The Phase 4 deliverable is the Killer App. * Linda sees: A single laptop that acts like an infinitely expanding rack of computers.
 * The Dev sees: A clean SQLite table and a few podman pause/unpause commands.

📝 Final "Spine" Handoff Check

| Rule | Status | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| No DRM Master | Locked | Prevents personas from bricking the display. |
| Sibling Tenants | Locked | Eliminates the performance penalty of nesting. |
| Socket Injection | Locked | Hardware-grade isolation for the AI core. |
| Immutable Root | Locked | Guaranteed "Fresh Boot" every single time. |

🛠️ One Final Technical "Warning" for the Devs

Implementing Phase A, 
watch the Mount Order.
 * Kernel
 * initramfs
 * Mount /persist (This is the only way bay0 can find its "Brain," the SQLite DB).
 * Pivot_root to the immutable Spine.
